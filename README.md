# SALT2X
The SALT2X light curve fitting method implemented in SNCOSMO

The JLA light curves should be placed in a directory called "JLA/jla_light_curves".
In that directory should be a list of full paths to each light curve called 
jla_lc.txt. You can create this file by calling:
`find `pwd` -name "*.list"`
from the jla_light_curves directory.
